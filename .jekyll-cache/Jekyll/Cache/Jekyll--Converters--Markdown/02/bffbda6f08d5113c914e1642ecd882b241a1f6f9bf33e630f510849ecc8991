I"Á<p>Today is Thanksgiving in America, and despite being a Brit I thought it would be good to try and post something Iâ€™m thankful for this year. I started to write this post at lunchtime, and struggled, I couldnâ€™t zero in on something. This evening after my counselling session I realised what it is Iâ€™m thankful for this year. Iâ€™m thankful for all the people who have helped my family navigate through the year. The members of their church, some old friends from previous churches, some new friends, some new colleagues who have become friends. Some people who were friends and Iâ€™ve discovered are now very good friends. For all of them I am thankful, we couldnâ€™t have done it without you.</p>
