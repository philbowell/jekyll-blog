I"µ<p>On my lunch break today as I sat reading some RSS feeds, I came across a [Daily Blogging Challenge] that started on the first of March. As I clicked through to the organising site to find out more I discovered that each day they are sharing a prompt word that everyone taking part should use to kickstart their post for the day. Iâ€™m not going to commit to taking part everyday, but I liked the prompt from 1st March, [routine].</p>
