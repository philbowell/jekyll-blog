I"ò<p>Itâ€™s been just under a year since I began trialling <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> as the basis of my blog. At the time I was writing from <a href="http://phil.electricweekend.com/">Electric Weekend</a> but had been struggling thanks to several events that happened at the end of 2009. In an attempt to get back in to the swing of blogging Iâ€™d decided to make a clean break from my first blog and start again.</p>

<p>For a while I posted regularly but I soon fell in to a trap of consuming rather than writing. Tumblr makes it very easy to find new blogs to follow, not a bad thing, but I found it all too easy to consume rather than create. However, in the last month or so Iâ€™ve begun to feel that desire to create again, to write on a more regular basis. Not only that but I wanted more control, and this is the driving force behind my move back to a Wordpress based site.</p>

<h2 id="control">Control?</h2>
<p>One of the things I used to enjoy most about my old site was the ability to change things up should I feel theyâ€™ve become stale. I could more easily try out new features should I come across something I liked the look of. But it goes beyond this, I wanted more control of the fundamentals of the site.</p>

<p>One of the things that has frustrated me most, not necessarily with my site, but with the sites of bloggers who use Tumblr, is the poor archives. Itâ€™s frustrated me that Iâ€™ve not been able to find a link or an article on someoneâ€™s site. Itâ€™s such a bad experience that I began to think people, or at least some people, will have the same trouble finding things on my site as Iâ€™m having here.</p>

<p>It all boils down to the fact that Iâ€™d like to design the overall experience people have on my site and the only way I can do that is to move to a self-hosted platform.</p>

<h2 id="theme">Theme?</h2>
<p>So having admitted Iâ€™d like to have more control over my site, here I am using a default theme. Well the answer to that is simple. I wanted to make the move while I had the desire to write more. Iâ€™ve already wasted a month knowing I wanted to leave Tumblr, and so rather than wait until Iâ€™d got a fully designed blog I decided to make the move now and begin tailoring my site as I settle in to my new surroundings.</p>

<p>But not everything is running without some customisation. Iâ€™ve already begun my design process with the URLâ€™s (Thanks to a little inspiration from <a href="http://ianhin.es/wrote-about/designing-urls-for-humans/">Ian Hines</a>.) which feature a more friendly sentence like structure that I hope will grow as I develop the site.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll also notice that comments are available on this post. Having not had comments on my site for a long time Iâ€™ve begun to feel that on certain posts it might be quite nice to try and foster a bit of conversation, they wonâ€™t be on by default but I hope to be able to turn them on from time to time.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m also hoping to find a way to bring most of the content from my Tumblr site into this one so that everything from PBcom can be archived here. But whilst all this is going on, I now feel I have a website where I can start to be myself again. Somewhere Iâ€™m hopeful I can get back into the flow of blogging regularly, with a mixture of long form articles and links. A place where Iâ€™m happy to create is far more important to me than discovering even more content. This year Iâ€™m hoping to use my time more wisely, and hopefully this move is the first step in using my online time in a more productive manner.</p>
