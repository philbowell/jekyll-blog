I"Æ<p>Iâ€™ve written 442 posts on this site. The first one was written on 17th January 2011, thatâ€™s five and half years ago. It equates to around 80 posts per year and about 1.5 posts per week. Itâ€™s not bad going, but it could be better.</p>

<p>During those times thereâ€™s been many spells of inactivity and many spells of multiple posts per day, this is what I would like to change most about my site, the inconsistent posting patterns. Last night I found myself browsing the web in a way that Iâ€™ve not done for a long time. I ended up on a rabbit trail of personal blogs, one that started with a site I subscribe to that I kicked off into safari on my iPad. It felt like rediscovering the internet again. This was what got me into the blogging scene way back in 2005 when I started my first blog. There was a line in one of the articles I read that resonated with me. It was feedback that the author received regularly,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Stopping blogging regularly was one of peopleâ€™s biggest regrets. I certainly wish I hadnâ€™t stopped. Or I should say, I wish I hadnâ€™t let the habit slip.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I started blogging way back in 2005 Iâ€™ve had two main sites. The first site, which sadly is no longer in existence, lasted from 2006 until this site started in 2011. It was my first proper foray into internet publishing and as a result I didnâ€™t really think too much about what I would post. Topics were wide in range but naturally reflected my personal interests, something which I feel has been lost a bit on this site. Which is somewhat ironic given that this is the site which bears my full name in the url.</p>

<p>With that in mind itâ€™s time to declare that this is the first post in a new challenge Iâ€™m setting myself. I want to recapture the joy that I had when I first started publishing on the web. It was something I enjoyed and did everyday, and so, thatâ€™s my new challenge. I want to post to this site everyday until the end of the year. Some will be links, some will be original writing, but all of it will reflect me and my interests. Iâ€™m going to try my utmost not to pick and choose too much of what I write, I will simply write and post each day from now until December 31st.</p>
