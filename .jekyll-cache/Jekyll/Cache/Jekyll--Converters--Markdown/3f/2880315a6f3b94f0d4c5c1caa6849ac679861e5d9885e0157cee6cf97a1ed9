I"Í<p>Part of my approach to the new year involved rediscovering one of my habits. Iâ€™ve been trying to <a href="https://philbowell.com/2022/i-want-my-hobby-back">write a blog post more often</a>. I initially intended to use my Micro.blog and to post all my content there, but given the chance to reflect I realised I wanted my longer posts to live here. Iâ€™m not committing to a set number of posts per week, but I am committing to posting here more often.</p>
