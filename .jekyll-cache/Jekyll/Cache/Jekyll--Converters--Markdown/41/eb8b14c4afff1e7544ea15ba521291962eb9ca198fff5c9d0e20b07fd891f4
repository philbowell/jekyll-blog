I"‰<p>Thereâ€™s so much stuff on the internet that it seems like an impossibility that you would read something at exactly the time you need to read it. Austin Kleonâ€™s recent article about <a href="https://medium.com/@austinkleon/finding-your-bliss-station-436290c4da03">finding your bliss station</a> has managed to achieve just that.</p>

<p>Around a year ago I was just finishing up a course of counselling aimed at helping me understand the depression I was diagnosed with in January 2015. One of the things I learnt about myself was my need to do creative things for myself and how over the year prior to my diagnosis I had stopped doing that. This evening as I read Austinâ€™s article it hit home a little further, I mightâ€™ve lost my cave a little bit.</p>

<p>This week has been a tough one, the first tough week for a while which is something I know happens to everyone now and again. A giveaway sign, which Iâ€™ve realised as I write this, is the recurrence of the word introvert in a lot of my snippets/tweets. Iâ€™ve been craving time on my own, and that usually happens when Iâ€™m starting to feel a bit unbalanced in life. Itâ€™s a little clue that I mightâ€™ve lost my bliss station, or cave as Iâ€™ve referred to it in the past.</p>

  Whatâ€™s clear is that itâ€™s healthiest if we make a daily appointment to disconnect from the world so that we can connect with ourselves.

<p>In counsellor speak this is called <em>self care</em>. We need to take time out to take care of ourselves, to stop ourselves being bombarded by the world around us. To find a place that frees us from the stresses of work, from running a business and working for someone else at the same time. From being around people all day, to having a few moments to our ourselves each and everyday. To take a little bit of time to do something we want to do just because we enjoy it and it helps us feel free.</p>

<p>By Sunday evening I plan to have reclaimed my cave from the dumping ground itâ€™s become, and in the spirit of making better use of my calendar I plan to schedule in a time everyday for me to be in it just because I want to create some stuff for myself.</p>
