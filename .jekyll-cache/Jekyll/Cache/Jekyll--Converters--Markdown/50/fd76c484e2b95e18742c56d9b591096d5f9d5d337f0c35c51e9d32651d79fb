I"<p>Thereâ€™s an odd pressure when youâ€™re trying to exercise the muscle of discipline, itâ€™s tempting to want everything you do as a part of that to be the best that it can be. Sometimes you need to just push through and exercise that muscle. When youâ€™re starting out, quantity is often more important than quality. You need to get used to doing something regularly before you can focus on doing it better, otherwise the fear of <em>not good enough</em> can hold you back and prevent you from making the progress you want to make.</p>
