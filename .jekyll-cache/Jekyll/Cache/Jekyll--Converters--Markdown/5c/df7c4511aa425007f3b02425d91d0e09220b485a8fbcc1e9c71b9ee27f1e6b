I"ô<p>The desire to tinker is strong in this one.</p>

<p>I have this problem when it comes to my blog. The more I start to post to it, the more I want to tinker. The more active I am on the site, the more I notice little things I donâ€™t like and want to fix. The more I post to it, the more I want all my internet posting to originate on it. Itâ€™s like an illness.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve always struggled with, and I confess itâ€™s a side to blogging that I enjoy. The trouble is, the more I tinker the less I post. The more I craft the design, the less time I spend writing.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a battle, although one Iâ€™m sure I do not face alone. Itâ€™s not just the battle of a blogger, itâ€™s a battle of a designer. Most of the tinkering I do is design related, little details and quirks in my theme which I notice but very few others will. I also know from experience, that I will get to the point where Iâ€™ve caught the little tweaks I need to and they will be fixed. Then itâ€™s just a case of resisting the bigger things Iâ€™d like to do. Or at least knocking off the major ones first, like finding a way to post photos here and on Instagram, displaying them in a way Iâ€™m happy with. The key though, is to keep the posts flowing. Keep to my challenge of posting everyday, and getting through the tinkering stage until I get to the point where Iâ€™m just posting each day and all my published content originates here.</p>

<p>Or is it just a pipe dream? Should I just keep posting and ignore the little bits that nag?</p>

<p>But I know I canâ€™t just ignore the nagging. Iâ€™m a designer, I like details and its in my nature to keep refining bits until theyâ€™re gone. To keep crafting until they as close to perfect as can be, itâ€™s just important to keep the perspective, to keep in mind that perfect doesnâ€™t exist. Itâ€™s about getting things to good enough whilst keeping on posting each day and building momentum so that the writing takes over the tinkering and becomes a creative outlet in its own right.</p>
