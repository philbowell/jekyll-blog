I"—<p>Sometimes a day hits you when things that are normally easy to do become the hardest things. I mean simple things like getting out of bed, going downstairs and making a coffee. Thatâ€™s the nature of depression.</p>

<p>When it happens you have to find ways of getting through because giving in to it can be crippling. Giving in can be the start of a downward spiral, a spiral you donâ€™t want to be in and that can take a long time to get out of. Thatâ€™s a place you donâ€™t want to go. Instead you have to find a way to push through, to stop the down from taking over. What that looks like is the tricky part, but for everyone there is way of doing it.</p>
