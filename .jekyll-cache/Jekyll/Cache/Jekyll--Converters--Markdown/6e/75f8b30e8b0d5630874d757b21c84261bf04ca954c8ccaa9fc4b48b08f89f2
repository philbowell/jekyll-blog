I"÷<p>Part of my approach to the new year involved rediscovering one of my habits. Iâ€™ve been trying to <a href="https://philbowell.com/2022/i-want-my-hobby-back">write a blog post more often</a>. I initially intended to use my Micro.blog and to post all my content there, but given the chance to reflect I realised I wanted my longer posts to live here. Iâ€™m not committing to a set number of posts per week, but I am committing to posting here more often.</p>

<p>All week Iâ€™ve been thinking about what to write about. Everytime I opened my iPad and sat down to write something I couldnâ€™t think of anything to write. It started to become a problem. I wanted to write a post, but I didnâ€™t know what to write. I wanted to write a post but I began to feel like I didnâ€™t have anything to say. I wanted to write but I began to believe I didnâ€™t have anything to say or write.</p>

<p>This is evening as I sat here recovering from my counselling session I was bumbling around on the internet. Something made me google a photographer whose blog I used to follow years ago. I even have one of his photos. To my delight I found his website and realised he was still blogging regularly. As I scrolled through his posts I came across one titled <a href="https://www.jorgeq.com/blog/stop-hiding-behind-complexity">Stop hiding behind complexity</a>. The first line struck me:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Whether we like to admit it or not, we sometimes enjoy making the simplest task more difficult because itâ€™s easier to blame the many loops it would have taken to finish it if we donâ€™t succeed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realised perhaps this is what Iâ€™m doing with my blog. I want to write a post but I think that I need to write something significant. Instead of sitting down to write something, be it about something Iâ€™ve read or done this week, Iâ€™m making the simple task complicated. The likelihood is that itâ€™s easier to not post something and hide behind the thought that I have nothing to say than it is to open Obsidian and write until Iâ€™ve put something together worth posting. If I want to write for my blog more often, it should be as simple as writing a post and publishing it. No second guessing myself and no worrying about whether I have something to say. Just writing.</p>
