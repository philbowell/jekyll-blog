I"Â<p>Today has been a grey and foggy day, itâ€™s felt like a real reflection of the mood of the last month. As Iâ€™ve driven around Cheltenham today doing some bits and bobs, Iâ€™ve seen more and more people starting to put up Christmas trees and lights. Itâ€™s been nice to see them emerging out of the gloom.</p>

<p>Today marks the start of Advent, with the first candle being lit in churches across the country we are reminded of the hope that comes from Jesus. The arrival of the King.</p>

<p>At the start of this year I started to go to a new church, given the pandemic if might not have been the best time, but the services Iâ€™ve been attending online have been ones of great comfort. They have shown great care, sensitivity, and compassion throughout the year, and Iâ€™m incredibly thankful that God guided me to this church. Iâ€™m looking forward to being able to go to a service again, I hope it is sooner rather than later. Iâ€™m sure it will be.</p>
