I"¸<p>Last week I was away at the CMJ Conference, I had the pleasure of joining them to take photos of the event, post to social media throughout it on their accounts, and to hear some excellent bible teaching in the process. It lasted from Friday afternoon to late Sunday afternoon, and by the time I got home I was absolutely exhausted. I spent most of the week recovering whilst trying to work and, thankfully, have spent most of this weekend doing some serious introverting at home.</p>

<p>Last Saturday afternoon while I was sat on the sofa reading and watching Le Tour, it struck me that we are nearly at the end of July. Weâ€™re over halfway through the year and it seemed like a good time to review some of the goals I set out with at the start of the year.</p>

<p>For those who donâ€™t know, I laid them out in my <a href="http://philbowell.com/now/" title="My now page">now page</a> at the start of the year, which saw an update in April. Whilst I didnâ€™t make a post here about those updates, a mid year review of those aims seems like a good thing to make note of.</p>

<h4>Health &amp; Personal</h4>
<p>One of my aims at the start of the year was to take better care of myself than Iâ€™ve done in previous years. I bought a Fitbit and set out to hit the 10,000 steps per day goal. That aim is going reasonably well. Iâ€™m hitting an average of 9,219 steps per day, which isnâ€™t quite the 10,000 Iâ€™m aiming for. However when you consider that Iâ€™ve spent a total of 2 weeks taken out by illness (thanks former housemates for sharing your bugs) or my wisdom tooth operation when I barely hit 1000 steps a day, Iâ€™ll take it.</p>

<p>In terms of exercise, I was playing football most weeks until it stopped for the summer, although I wasnâ€™t enjoying it quite as much as I had done. The couch to 5K plan hasnâ€™t really happened either, running is something I do not enjoy, I find it frustrating and boring so easily become demotivated to do it. I have however been doing a Fitstar work out most weeks since May, although I confess that June/July has not been great on this front Iâ€™ve started that up again this weekend.</p>

<h4>Faith</h4>
<p>Iâ€™m pleased to say that I am still working through the 5 Day Reading Plan. Iâ€™ve gotten behind a few times but never more than a week, and whatâ€™s more, I donâ€™t find myself reading out of obligation but out of desire to keep reading The Word of The Lord.</p>

<p>My use of the Prayer Mate app has also continued although much more spottily. I go through phases of using it everyday and then phases of only using it here and there. Thatâ€™s ok though, itâ€™s a tool after all and not an obligation or the only way to pray. The times Iâ€™ve used it well itâ€™s been beneficial, but so have the times when I have not used it as much.</p>

<p>When it comes to the memorisation of scripture, Iâ€™ve not been quite so good. The Verses app is still on my iPhone, but I havenâ€™t used it as much as I hoped. I plan to be more intentional over the second half of the year to make use of this app.</p>

<h4>Freelancing</h4>
<p>Iâ€™m still continuing to do this, and in fact the last couple of months have been busy and very enjoyable. Please do recommend me or get in touch if you know anyone who might need some design work.</p>

<h4>This Site</h4>
<p>I am posting to this site more regularly, although the majority of the posts are small status type posts I have been able to post a few more considered posts. One thing Iâ€™ve noticed it that I am posting less links which means that more of the content here is original and not pointing to somewhere else. One thing I have decided to do is put less pressure on myself to post, itâ€™s my site after all and so why should there be a pressure to put something here if Iâ€™m not feeling creative in that way.</p>

<p>I have also started another <a href="http://phil.coffee" title="Flat white &amp; AeroPress">side project</a>, and I canâ€™t decide whether to dual post here as well as there. In the mean time it will remain where it is and on Medium as a publication.</p>

<h4>Reading</h4>
<p>My Goodreads Reading Challenge is on track. Of the 25 books I pledged to read Iâ€™ve read 13 so far and am a good chunk through 2 more. Once again the number of fiction books are outweighing the non-fiction ones, which is understandable as I read at the end of each day to help me relax, it is something I would like to be more even over the next half of the year.</p>

<p>On reflection itâ€™s been a pretty good first half of the year, both in terms of the goals I set out to accomplish and in some of the things that happen in life. My prayer is that the second will continue in this vein, perhaps with a bit more progress on the healthier living side of things than Iâ€™ve had so far.</p>
