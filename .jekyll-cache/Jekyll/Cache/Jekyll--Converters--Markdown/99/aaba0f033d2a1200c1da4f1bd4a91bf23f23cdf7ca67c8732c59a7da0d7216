I"Ñ<p>Barriers are a strange thing. In the real world they exist to form a separation, a physical division between two things. They can be permanent or temporary, but they exist for a specific reason. Their purpose though, is always the same, to prevent you from going somewhere you shouldnâ€™t.</p>

<p>In the mental world things are slightly different. Barriers exist of course, but for different reasons, though their purpose is similar to their real world counterparts, they stop you going somewhere or doing something. The trouble is, they arenâ€™t physical and that makes them immeasurably harder to overcome.</p>

<p>Eighteen weeks ago I started posting a <a href="http://philbowell.com/category/week-in-links/">weekly article with a collection of links</a> to interesting articles Iâ€™ve read during the week. I started it because I wanted to get back into writing for my blog. I thought having a regular post to commit to would remove the barrier that I seemed to have errected over the last couple of years. To a degree itâ€™s worked, posting to my blog regularly has helped me to rebuild my interest in it, itâ€™s helped me to establish a desire to post, but it hasnâ€™t removed the barrier.</p>

<p>For the last few weeks Iâ€™ve started each week with the aim that this week would be the one that gets me writing a post a week. Several times Iâ€™ve drafted something, but each time Iâ€™ve failed to publish it. Fear seems to be the barrier preventing me from clicking that button. That little voice that says <em>No one will read it, no one really cares what you have to say</em> squarks away as my mouse hovers over the publish button.</p>

<p>So Iâ€™ve decided, this week <strong>is</strong> going to be the week that I breakdown that barrier. The little voice <strong>will</strong> be silenced and I <strong>will</strong> post an article every Wednesday from here on out. It is a challenge, but one I want. I have no idea what I will post about, but as Shawn Blanc says <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2015/06/you-have-ideas/">I have ideas</a> itâ€™s just a case of letting them grow and taking a bit of action on some of them, regardless of whether they are good or bad, as well as having a bit of courage to press publish at the end of it.</p>
