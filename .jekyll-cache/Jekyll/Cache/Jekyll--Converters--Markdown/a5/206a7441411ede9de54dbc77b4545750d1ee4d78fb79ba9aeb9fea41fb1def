I"ž<p>I know what youâ€™re thinking. Itâ€™s only the second day of the challenge I set myself, to post to my blog everyday from now until the end of the year, and already Iâ€™m asking the question of what do I write about.</p>

<p>I would imagine itâ€™s a familiar story to anyone whoâ€™s decided to undertake such a challenge. Going from barely writing or posting to your blog to posting everyday itâ€™s only natural to find yourself wondering what to write about. If I hadnâ€™t been here before it would be a big worry, it might even be so discouraging that I would just abandon ship straight away. Whilst this morning when I decided it was time to write todayâ€™s post I didnâ€™t have anything in particular I wanted to write about I know that if I keep going and posting each day I will eventually end up with too many subjects to write about. Itâ€™s the nature of the beast, the more you do it, the more ideas you have.</p>

<p>There are a number of different tactics that Iâ€™ve come across over the years that are aimed at helping you come up with subjects to write about. Unsurprisingly none of them have ever worked for me, but there is one thing that does. I know it works because Iâ€™ve demonstrated it in other parts of my life, be it reading my bible or doing the work for my freelance business.</p>

<p>Showing up every day.</p>

<p>So here I am, showing up. A new sheet in Ulysses, my headphones in and Iâ€™m writing. In fact through the course of writing this post Iâ€™ve already come up with the topic for tomorrowâ€™s post. There it is in action. Showing up today has triggered the process. The more you do something the more ideaâ€™s you have, the first step is showing up.</p>
