I"›<p>Thereâ€™s nothing quite like writing down the routine youâ€™ve found yourself falling into to make you realise thereâ€™s somethings youâ€™d like to change. When I <a href="https://philbowell.com/2021/routines/" title="Routines">posted</a> about my routine the other week it made me more conscious of what Iâ€™ve been doing in the morning so I started to pay more attention to what I was doing last week.</p>
