I"à<p>Iâ€™ve recently made some changes to the hosting for my blog and other websites as part of the consolidation of my many websites in to one. I had been aiming to have one website to rule them all integrating my portfolio and my blog into one site.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m in the process of creating a new theme to help accomplish that, but I realised that for a long time Iâ€™ve not wanted to post the short status posts and images on to this site. I used to use Twitter for that, and whilst Iâ€™m still on the site I rarely use it. Iâ€™ve also been a member of [Micro.Blog] since the kickstarter days, but lately Iâ€™ve found myself just observing with only the occasional reply and not actually contributing. So Iâ€™ve decided to give something a try.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve setup a hosted Micro Blog, which will use one of my spare personal domains, and Iâ€™m going to try posting to there with the short status posts and images as I wouldâ€™ve done on Twitter and Instagram. Iâ€™ll likely use it to share things links and things along the way. In contrast I plan to keep this blog as somewhere to post longer posts and in time to add my portfolio as well.</p>

<p>To simplify things, Iâ€™m thinking about using my Micro Blog and this blog as ways of generating some [Stock and Flow]. As Robin Sloan put it:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Flow is the feed. Itâ€™s the posts and the tweets. Itâ€™s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that reminds people you exist.
Stock is the durable stuff. Itâ€™s the content you produce thatâ€™s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. Itâ€™s what people discover via search. Itâ€™s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.
Iâ€™ve realised Iâ€™ve lost those concepts in my creative work. I no longer tweet and I donâ€™t blog regularly, so if I can start to correct that I hope that the two blog formats can inform one another with more content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As an extension of that Iâ€™ve also been thinking a lot about Austin Kleonâ€™s book [Show Your Work], something which Iâ€™ve also not been doing much of lately. My hope is that Iâ€™ll be able to combine these two sites and ways of posting with showing some of my work. Be it personal or professional (when appropriate). Weâ€™ll see how it goes.</p>
