<p>There are some posts you dream about writing, posts youâ€™d love to write but never think you actually will. This is one of those posts.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I wrote a post about change. Changing the way I approached something has lead to exciting guidance and a big change in my career.</p>

<p>It started with a conversation with two very good friends of mine. One asked how work was, then followed it up with a query about what I really wanted to do. The other laughed, asked me a question, set me a challenge and then held me to it. That question lead me to writing the last post about a change of approach, a change which, thanks to Gods guidance is leading to a leap of faith.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the leap?</p>

<p>On Friday 3rd August I worked my last day in full time employment and spent my last day living in sunny (!?) Slough. The following day I moved to Cheltenham, again. A place I attended university and a place that I love being in.</p>

<p>With that move came a change of employment. I am no longer a rat running a race, but instead a man working as a business owner. Iâ€™ve finally taken the leap into self employment. Relying on the Lord to supply me with enough work to put food in my stomach and to pay the bills.</p>

<p>For a long time itâ€™s been my ambition to work for myself, even while I was studying at Uni I knew ultimately I wanted to have my own design studio. It nearly happened straight after Uni after a little encouragement from my tutor, but I knew it wasnâ€™t really the right time. There was a lot I still had to learn, well letâ€™s face it there still is. Iâ€™ve now been in full time employment for 5 years. Iâ€™ve grown a lot, Iâ€™ve changed a lot and Iâ€™ve learnt a lot. Iâ€™ve experienced working for a small company and Iâ€™ve experienced working for a larger company. Both were good experiences that taught me many different things, but underneath there was always this desire to have my own company bubbling away.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m delighted to say that has now happened. Iâ€™ve had a little holiday, moved to a new (old) place and am at the end of my first week of self employment. Itâ€™s exciting, a little daunting but feels like the best decision Iâ€™ve made. Except that I didnâ€™t make it, God showed me the door and I pushed it. Now Iâ€™ve got to continue pushing doors, keep faithful to Him, and work as hard as I can.</p>

<p>In the next couple of weeks Iâ€™ll be able to introduce you to a new name and a new website. Of course this place will still exist and I hope to increase the level of writing, and hopefully build on some friendships that Iâ€™ve established through my blog over the years. Itâ€™s an exciting adventure, I hope youâ€™ll join me on it!</p>
