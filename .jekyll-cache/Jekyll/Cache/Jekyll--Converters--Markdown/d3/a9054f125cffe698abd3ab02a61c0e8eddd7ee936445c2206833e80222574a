I"ª<p>I like to shave.</p>

<p>Ask most men my age, their late twenties, that question and its usually met with a snort. An upturned lip. A look that says â€œare you serious?â€ without words passing their lips.</p>

<p>In fact if you asked me that question a few years ago I wouldâ€™ve responded in much the same way.</p>

<p>So what changed I hear you say? My approach changed. When I moved into a flat to live on my own for the first time I became much more aware of how I spent my money, every penny suddenly counted much more than it ever had. Spending several pounds on a can of shaving gel had to stop. So I bought a cheap shaving brush and a puck of soap that I knew would last far longer than the shaving gel ever had.</p>

<p>That small change began something. Since it took me a bit longer to have a shave I started to relax, to take my time with it. I began to see shaving as a time to pamper myself and relax. I started to enjoy it.</p>

<p>Fast forward a couple of years, and although Iâ€™ve had an electric razor for quick shaves during the week, Iâ€™ve always enjoyed my Saturday morning wet shave. Once again an awareness of how I spend my money has prompted another change in my shaving set up. I ran out of cartridges for my Mach 3 and on going to buy some new ones, the cost floored me. I canâ€™t spend Â£13 on 8 razor heads which will last me only a couple of months before threatening to pull the skin off my face.</p>

<p>I took to Amazon to find out if they were cheaper, they werenâ€™t, but one of their handy suggestions based on other peoples purchasing habits was. Iâ€™m not talking slightly either, Iâ€™m talking Â£9 for 100 blades. A grand total of 9p per blade and according to the internet (means itâ€™s true right?), each blade should last me 5 or 6 shaves. Thatâ€™s about 2p per shave. So I took the next step in my shaving career and bought a double edged safety razor for Â£20. That means in just over 6 months Iâ€™ll be saving money and in 2 years time Iâ€™ll still be using the same pack of blades. Brilliant.</p>

<p>But do you know whatâ€™s even more brilliant?</p>

<p>I enjoy shaving even more now. I have to take even more time with it, making two or three passes over my face. Iâ€™ve had to relearn how to make a lather, turns out I was doing it wrong but the Mach 3 didnâ€™t show it up. In fact Iâ€™ve had to relearn how to shave entirely, but it hasnâ€™t been a chore. I now shave 3 times a week, using similar tools to my Granddad who I remember getting up early to shave in the kitchen sink. He used to take his time, I never understood why.</p>

<p>I do now.</p>

<p>Shaving isnâ€™t a chore. Itâ€™s a relaxing, soothing treat, and a great way to start the day, or finish it if youâ€™ve had particularly stressful one. In fact itâ€™s more than that. Itâ€™s a pause, a moment in time where Iâ€™m not thinking about anything else (I tried it once; blood everywhere), itâ€™s an opportunity to give my mind a rest and just enjoy the moment.</p>
