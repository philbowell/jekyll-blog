I"O<blockquote>
  <p>Life is about tradeoffs. </p>

  <p>When we know what to say no to, and we know why, we can say yes with comfort and confidence to the things that matter. To the things that last.</p>

  <p>Work, family, scene. </p>

  <p>You can have two if you say no to one. If you can’t, you’ll have none.</p>
