<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve found it incredibly difficult to make time for long-form writing the past few years. When I have, the catalyst has been reminding myself of the tremendous ROI as a designer, manager, business owner, and so on.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to be a better designer, write more.
If you want to be a better manager, write more.
If you want to be a better biz owner, write more.
You can also substitute “speak more” for each of these.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The act of synthesising what’s in your head for an audience of critics leads to increased analytical thinking, self-awareness, clarity, and much more.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Last but not least, you inspire others to write—or at the very least ‘write’ by joining the conversation you’ve started.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s something I’ve been thinking about lots the last couple of weeks. I’ve been wanting to post to my blog more because I think it will be beneficial for me in many ways, one of which to help me build &lt;a href=”http://philbowell.com/2018/thoughts-on-just-turning-up/”&gt;discipline&lt;/a&gt; and self-control in other areas of my life.</p>

<p>The thing that really strikes me about this Twitter thread, the whole thing would make a good blog post. It probably would’ve been easier to post to a blog as well, likely have a longer life span, and consequently have more of an impact. Not all writing on a blog has to be long to have an impact, if it’s worth stringing four tweets together in a thread to make a point, it’s worthy of a blog post.</p>
