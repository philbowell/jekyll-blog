  <p>Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s always bothered me about task management systems: itâ€™s not what Presidents use.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve never thought of <a href="http://cjchilvers.com/blog/kill-your-to-do-list" title="Kill Your To Do List">this</a> before. Itâ€™s never even crossed my mind about the methods of working for people in high powered positions, or national office. Yet it <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/81416705736990410/" title="Lincoln's Routine">shouldnâ€™t be</a> a surprise when you think about.
After reading this excellent article from CJ Chilvers it struck me that in the last few months this is something Iâ€™ve started to do subconsciously.When I think back to how Iâ€™ve progressed some projects recently itâ€™s all been down to clearly blocking out time on my calendar and then working during those times.</p>

<p>Of course Iâ€™ve not entirely scrapped my to do list, and I think it would be wrong to scrap it completely. Itâ€™s a useful tool for keeping track of the client projects Iâ€™m working on. The important thing, I think, is to not let your to do list dictate your time and instead to let your calendar dictate your to do list.</p>

  <p>The calendar doesnâ€™t lie. Itâ€™s brutal about how much time you actually have in a day to complete your projects. Itâ€™s honest. We need to stop wishing,Â determine whatâ€™s important enough to spend our very limited time on and get it scheduled.</p>
