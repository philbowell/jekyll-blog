I"¦<p>Back in October of 2014 I wiped this blog and started all over again in an attempt at a fresh start and the beginning of more regular posting. The lack of baggage was supposed to be the catalyst to help me post, to a degree it has worked and Iâ€™ve been posting here much more regularly since the turn of the year. The Week in Links has helped, and is approaching itâ€™s six month anniversary.</p>

<p>On Monday evening I read a <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/10-years-blogging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post by Paul Stamatiou</a> about his years of blogging. I was struck by a particular sentence half way through:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The era of the personal website is over. Itâ€™s now just a personal landing page with a photo, bio and link to a Twitter profile.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand exactly where he is coming from, but I also disagree, to a certain extent. Itâ€™s true a lot of websites have disappeared over the last few years, but over the last few months Iâ€™ve seen a resurgence in the personal site/blog. Something that I want to be a part of. It got me thinking about my own personal site, and the changes itâ€™s been through over the last decade. Iâ€™ve never binned it to replace it with a personal site, but I did recently delete all my posts and before that I had another blog that has gone the way of the Dodo.</p>

<p>It struck me how wrong that is. I put a lot of time and effort into writing those posts, and for them to be erased is just plain wrong. Fortunately I managed to locate a backup of this site from just before I wiped it, and Iâ€™ve now added all the posts back into the archive. Thereâ€™s still a bit of tidying up to do but for the most part the archives now extend all the way back to January 2011. Iâ€™m also hoping to be able to locate an old backup of my very first blog, the one that existed prior to this one. Iâ€™ve been writing on the internet for nearly a decade now, it should be preserved and maintained in some form or another not consigned to oblivion.</p>

<p>All of this to say, Iâ€™ve added the archives back to this place. If youâ€™re interested and have the time, why not have a dig through and see what you can find.</p>
