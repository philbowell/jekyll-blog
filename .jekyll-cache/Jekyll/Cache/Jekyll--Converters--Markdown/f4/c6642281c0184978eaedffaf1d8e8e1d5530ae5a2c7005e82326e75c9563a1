I"I<p>I’ve been trying to establish some new habits lately so &lt;a href=”https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/establishing-new-habits-without-apps”&gt;this was a timely post&lt;/a&gt; from CJ Chilvers. I’ve been using the app Streaks like he mentions to keep focused on some of my habits, but there is a certain lack of accountability that goes with it. When a big streak gets broken it’s very hard to find the energy to start again.</p>

<p>One thing I’ve found a bit easier to face when starting—or restarting—a project is to break it down to months. Define the goal, decide to begin it at the start of the next month, and then make sure you’re ready to go in the time in between. The space allows you to process what you’re aiming to accomplish, and allows you the time you need to make sure you’re ready to get going.</p>
