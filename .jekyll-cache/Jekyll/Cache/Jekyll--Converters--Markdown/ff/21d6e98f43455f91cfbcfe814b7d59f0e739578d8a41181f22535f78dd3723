I"Ì<p>Tonight I came across two blog posts in Reeder as I was lying in bed catching up on my feeds and watching the Formula One.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://audacious.blog/2021/write/">first</a> was all about writing. The author coined a phrase that is very reminiscent of Michael Pollanâ€™s approach to food.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Write sentences, not too many, mostly active.
It riffs nicely off
Eat food, not too much, mostly plants
Something which Iâ€™m trying to stick too but not very good at. It might have connected with me because itâ€™s familiar, but I think it goes a bit deeper than that. Iâ€™ve been trying to write more lately. I want to post a lot more regularly than I do, but often feel that Iâ€™m not contributing enough to warrant a post.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gabz.me/2021/03/25/just-blog.html" title="Just blog">second</a> seemed to know what I am thinking and hit me between the eyes.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Just blog, if thatâ€™s all you want to do.
This weekend I <a href="https://philbowell.micro.blog/2021/03/27/installed-ghost-locally.html">downloaded and installed Ghost</a> on my Mac. Iâ€™ve been looking at moving away from Wordpress for a while and finally took the time to look into one of the alternatives. But really itâ€™s just a distraction. I have a fully functional blog here. Iâ€™d like to change the design of it, but I donâ€™t need too. If I want to blog more, I should do it. So Iâ€™m going to try and write sentences about what Iâ€™m thinking, because I want too. That seems to be a good way of looking at things. I will still slowly work on a new design for this place, but Iâ€™m going to do my utmost to make sure that it doesnâ€™t stop me from posting more.</p>
