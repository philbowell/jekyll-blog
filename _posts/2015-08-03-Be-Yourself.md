title: Be Yourself
---
I can'&#8217;'t remember how I came across the article <a href="http://ift.tt/1E152hD">Be Yourself</a> by Tim Nahumck but I instanty saved it. I'&#8217;'ve read twice since then. It resonated with me, in fact the tweets by Aaron Mahnke which triggered this article resonated with me. But most of all, this quote is what I connected with the most. Never have I been more aware of the true meaning of this quote than in the last six months.
> I think for most, being yourself is one of the hardest things to do as a human. It takes a lot to get out of your own way, remove the internal barriers, and open up your world to others.
