title: Kill Your To Do List

> Here’s what’s always bothered me about task management systems: it’s not what Presidents use.

I’ve never thought of <a href="http://cjchilvers.com/blog/kill-your-to-do-list" title="Kill Your To Do List">this</a> before. It’s never even crossed my mind about the methods of working for people in high powered positions, or national office. Yet it <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/81416705736990410/" title="Lincoln's Routine">shouldn’t be</a> a surprise when you think about.
After reading this excellent article from CJ Chilvers it struck me that in the last few months this is something I’ve started to do subconsciously.When I think back to how I’ve progressed some projects recently it’s all been down to clearly blocking out time on my calendar and then working during those times.

Of course I’ve not entirely scrapped my to do list, and I think it would be wrong to scrap it completely. It’s a useful tool for keeping track of the client projects I’m working on. The important thing, I think, is to not let your to do list dictate your time and instead to let your calendar dictate your to do list.

> The calendar doesn't lie. It's brutal about how much time you actually have in a day to complete your projects. It's honest. We need to stop wishing, determine what's important enough to spend our very limited time on and get it scheduled.
