title: Deep Prayer &gt; Deep Work
---
There's been a lot of talk on the internet circles I follow about focus and deep work. They're thought provoking and often resonate with me, but there's one thing I've been struggling to reconcile in it all. The focus of all these discussions is usually aimed at putting your individual desires first, which doesn't really jive with my Christian beliefs.

Chris Bowler, in his excellently considered article \<a href="http://chrisbowler.com/journal/deep-prayer"\>Deep Prayer &#62; Deep Work\</a\>, seems to demonstrate I'm not alone. In doing so he seems to capture exactly how this kind of thinking should be influencing my approach to my faith.

But over and over, I come back to the fact that while Newport’s concept of increasing our ability to focus is crucial to a successful career, it’s even more crucial to a successful Christian life. One that is lived attuned to the Spirit. One that is carefully watching to see where God is working, then ready and willing to join him in it.
