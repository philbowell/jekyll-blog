title: Write sentences, what I’m thinking, because I want too

Tonight I came across two blog posts in Reeder as I was lying in bed catching up on my feeds and watching the Formula One.

The [first](https://audacious.blog/2021/write/) was all about writing. The author coined a phrase that is very reminiscent of Michael Pollan’s approach to food.
> Write sentences, not too many, mostly active.

It riffs nicely off

> Eat food, not too much, mostly plants

Something which I’m trying to stick too but not very good at. It might have connected with me because it’s familiar, but I think it goes a bit deeper than that. I’ve been trying to write more lately. I want to post a lot more regularly than I do, but often feel that I’m not contributing enough to warrant a post.

The [second](https://gabz.me/2021/03/25/just-blog.html "Just blog") seemed to know what I am thinking and hit me between the eyes.

> Just blog, if that’s all you want to do.

This weekend I [downloaded and installed Ghost](https://philbowell.micro.blog/2021/03/27/installed-ghost-locally.html) on my Mac. I’ve been looking at moving away from Wordpress for a while and finally took the time to look into one of the alternatives. But really it’s just a distraction. I have a fully functional blog here. I’d like to change the design of it, but I don’t need too. If I want to blog more, I should do it. So I’m going to try and write sentences about what I’m thinking, because I want too. That seems to be a good way of looking at things. I will still slowly work on a new design for this place, but I’m going to do my utmost to make sure that it doesn’t stop me from posting more.
