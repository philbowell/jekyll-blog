    <p>The last few months have been very quiet here at Electric Weekend, there’s been lots going on behind the scenes which have made it hard to write here. I covered some of those in the last post, but now I’m beginning to feel the desire to write again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I also feel as a person I’ve begun to out grow Electric Weekend, particularly as I look to present myself to be available for hire on a freelance basis. With that said, I’d like to introduce you to my new site <a href="http://philbowell.com">philbowell.com</a> or PBcom as it’s affectionally known by me. Phase one, the log, has just gone live and phase two, the portfolio, will follow suit in the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>What does this mean for Electric Weekend? It means I’ll no longer be posting here, the site will remain as an archive but from now on I’ll be posting on the log at PBcom. Please head over there, change your feed reader to point to the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/philbowell">new RSS feed</a> or give me a follow. Oh, and enjoy the new site.</p>
