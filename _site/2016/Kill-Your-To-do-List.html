  <p>Here’s what’s always bothered me about task management systems: it’s not what Presidents use.</p>

<p>I’ve never thought of <a href="http://cjchilvers.com/blog/kill-your-to-do-list" title="Kill Your To Do List">this</a> before. It’s never even crossed my mind about the methods of working for people in high powered positions, or national office. Yet it <a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/81416705736990410/" title="Lincoln's Routine">shouldn’t be</a> a surprise when you think about.
After reading this excellent article from CJ Chilvers it struck me that in the last few months this is something I’ve started to do subconsciously.When I think back to how I’ve progressed some projects recently it’s all been down to clearly blocking out time on my calendar and then working during those times.</p>

<p>Of course I’ve not entirely scrapped my to do list, and I think it would be wrong to scrap it completely. It’s a useful tool for keeping track of the client projects I’m working on. The important thing, I think, is to not let your to do list dictate your time and instead to let your calendar dictate your to do list.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The calendar doesn’t lie. It’s brutal about how much time you actually have in a day to complete your projects. It’s honest. We need to stop wishing, determine what’s important enough to spend our very limited time on and get it scheduled.</p>
