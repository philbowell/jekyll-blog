    <p>Occasionally I’ll come across an article on the internet that I find myself reading more than once. Usually it’s because the piece resonates deeply with me, but sometimes it’s because it’s something I want to be able to write myself. In this instance it’s just that, a piece I would like to be able to write in a years time, but with my own perspective.</p>

<p>In a piece about &lt;a href=”https://garrettdimon.com/2017/employment-vs-self-employment/”&gt;Employment vs. Self-Employment&lt;/a&gt; Garret Dimon wrote this paragraph.</p>

<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;
Being self-employed is great. And it’s not so great. Like anything, there are tradeoffs. For you, the tradeoffs may be worth it. Or, they might not. Or, they may not be the right tradeoffs at this point in your life. Just don’t put self-employment on a pedestal. There are plenty of other options that are darn near self-employment without the burdens.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>

<p>I’ve been on both ends of Employment and Self-Employment. For the last 5 years I’ve been running my own design business, and during the last year and a half of that I’ve been running it alongside another job in a coffee house. I’ve loved every minute of it, but it’s also been the most stressful time of my life. So stressful that it made me ill. The last couple of months I’ve been thinking about and making steps to begin looking for a full time design job working for someone. Through it all I have to keep reminding myself that self-employment is not the be all and end all, there is &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of important work being done by many different people and companies that it will be a privilege to be a part of.</p>
