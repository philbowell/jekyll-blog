    <p>Work/Life balance is a thing many of us struggle with. I know when I was 100% self-employed it was the thing I struggled with most, there was always something I felt I should be doing. Whilst many people claim that doing what you love means you have a perfect work/life balance that seems far to idealistic to me. Work is work, whether we love what we do or not and we need a good balance between it and the rest of our lives.</p>

<p>It seems Haptic Architects have that same awareness, and so I was interested to read about <a href="https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/22-28-may-2017/haptic-architects-teach-us-benefits-scandinavian-work-life-balance/">the Benefits of the Scandinavian Work/Life Balance</a> that they have implemented in their design studios. It seems a healthy approach to work and demonstrates a real awareness and care towards their employees.</p>
