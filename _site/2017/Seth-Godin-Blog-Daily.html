<p>title: Seth Godin Explains Why You Should Blog Daily
—
With the arrival of Micro.blog my interest in my blog has picked up considerably. It’s always been there bubbling at the back of my mind, but actively posting micro posts to it has me once again looking to post other content more regularly. CJ Chilvers linked to an article by Seth Godin that <a href="https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/seth-godin-explains-why-you-should-blog-daily">Explains Why You Should Blog Daily</a> resonated deeply with me and the growing desire to post to this site more regularly. It’s both a creative outlet both and a mental outlet that I know will be good for me. I intend to mix the content I post between links, quotes and original articles/thoughts alongside the afore mentioned <a href="https://micro.blog/philbowell" title="My Micro.blog">micro posts</a>.</p>
