    <p>I’ve been reading Austin Kleon’s blog since January, I find the way that he speaks about his notebooks and how he uses them very inspiring. Today’s post is about his &lt;a href=”https://austinkleon.com/2018/05/01/the-bulletin-board/”&gt;bulletin board&lt;/a&gt; and how he pins images, clippings, index cards, and various other bits to it for inspiration while he is writing a book.</p>

<p>The analog nature of lots of things that Austin does has really caught my attention. I love technology, but as a designer I also love objects and paper. When I was a student I covered the wall of my room in halls with bits of graphics that I liked. The whole thing turned into one giant collage of inspiration. That’s something I would like to get back into my creative life, something tactile and away from a glowing rectangle.</p>
