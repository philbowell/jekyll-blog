    <blockquote>
  <p>Today when you say “nest egg” many think of money saved and put away, but a literal “nest egg” is a real or fake egg that you put in a nest to encourage a bird or a hen to lay more eggs there. So what Thoreau is saying is that by simply writing down a thought, you encourage more thoughts to come. When you have enough thoughts pushed together in the same space — a collage of thoughts, juxtaposed — they often lead to something totally new.</p>

  <p>This is the magic of writing.</p>

<p>Austin Kleon <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/22/Thoughts-as-Nest-Eggs/">wrapped up a recent post</a> with the quote above. The post on one level is about journaling and writing in general, but do you know what else that quote describes? A blog.</p>

<p>A blog is nothing more than a series of thoughts written down over a period of time. When you think about it that way it’s incredibly freeing.  There should be no pressure. Instead there should just be turning up to write down a thought and seeing where it takes you.</p>
