    <p>On my lunch break today as I sat reading some RSS feeds, I came across a [Daily Blogging Challenge] that started on the first of March. As I clicked through to the organising site to find out more I discovered that each day they are sharing a prompt word that everyone taking part should use to kickstart their post for the day. I’m not going to commit to taking part everyday, but I liked the prompt from 1st March, [routine].</p>

<p>Routines have always been a bit of a comfort to me, mostly they just happen and I realise that I’ve settled in to one without considering what I’m doing. My morning routine for example is one that I’ve realised I’ve settled in to without really considering.</p>

<p>I wake up with my alarm around 07:00 and spend the next 45 minutes or so waking up. That involves a bit of snoozing, a bit of morning messaging, and a bit of bumbling around on the internet. Then I get out of bed and head towards the shower.</p>

<p>I’m usually dressed and ready to start my day by around 08:20. The next step is a glass of juice and my meds, followed by a sit down in my chair and a bit of time to have a quiet time with whatever reading plan I’m using in the Youversion app at the moment.</p>

<p>Around 08:40 I’ll turn on my Mac and head to the kitchen to make coffee and sort out some food for myself before I settle at my desk to contrive the days business.</p>

<p>I didn’t realise this was a routine I’d fallen in to until I came across Pablo Picasso’s daily schedule and it started me on path looking in to the routines of other famous creators, something I’ll be looking into and sharing here.</p>
