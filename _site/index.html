            <p>Today, the third Monday of January, is commonly referred to as Blue Monday. It’s considered to be the most depressing day of the year. By this time people are feeling down because they have broken all their New Year’s resolutions and there’s still another week until pay day.</p>

            <h2 class="h1"><a href="/2022/keep-it-simple">Keep it simple…</a></h2>
            <p>Part of my approach to the new year involved rediscovering one of my habits. I’ve been trying to <a href="https://philbowell.com/2022/i-want-my-hobby-back">write a blog post more often</a>. I initially intended to use my Micro.blog and to post all my content there, but given the chance to reflect I realised I wanted my longer posts to live here. I’m not committing to a set number of posts per week, but I am committing to posting here more often.</p>

            <h2 class="h1"><a href="/2022/Time-for-work-playlist">My time for work playlist</a></h2>
            <p>Over the years I’ve developed a few strategies to help get me in to the right frame of mind to work. One of the best ones is my time for work playlist, I put it on when I need to focus and it never fails to get me into the right state to focus on a project. I’ve worked out that the best albums for me to work to are film soundtracks. The nature of films means that they often build to a finale towards the end of the film, and the soundtracks have a big part to play in that. I find that as the urgency in the music builds my focus deepens and by the end of the soundtrack I’m immersed in my work.</p>

            <h2 class="h1"><a href="/2022/I-want-my-hobby-back">I want my hobby back</a></h2>
            <p>One thing I want to do more of this year it to write. Back when I started blogging in 2005 or 2006 I used to post everyday, often more than once. It might have been the novelty of being able to write something and have it appear on the internet for people to read that made it easier. It might also have been that the blogging community was in full force at the time, but one thing is for certain it was my hobby and I enjoyed it.</p>

            <p>This morning I found out that it’s world elephant day. It’s one of those facts which has stuck in my mind ever since for the simple fact that elephants are my favourite animals.</p>

            <h2 class="h1"><a href="/2021/Welcome-to-version-8">Welcome to version 8 of my blog</a></h2>
            <p>As the title says, welcome to the eighth official version of my blog. This one has been a while in the making. It started as a new theme on Wordpress over a year ago, included a short holiday on Ghost before ending up being powered by Jekyll. That makes this the first version of my blog not to be powered by Wordpress and in all honesty it’s a refreshing change.</p>

            <h2 class="h1"><a href="/2021/thinking">A tool for thinking</a></h2>
            <p>Yesterday as I was sat on my sofa watching the Sunday morning church service on YouTube I had my MacBook Pro open on my lap to make notes in Obsidian. After the service had finished I spent a few minutes to tidy up some formatting and make sure the correct bible verses were being referenced, I realised how much I am enjoying using the app. It got me thinking about why.</p>

            <p>Today is Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, in Israel. Racism has been in the news a lot of the last year or so, and yet we hear very little of the fact that anti-semitism is on the rise.</p>

            <p>I’ve been continuing to seek out a notes app that works for me as well as I would like it too. A couple of weeks ago I posted about <a href="https://philbowell.com/2021/searching-for-the-perfect-notes-app/">what I’m looking for</a> and since then I’ve been giving a couple of the contenders a try.</p>

            <h2 class="h1"><a href="/2021/write-sentences">Write sentences, what I’m thinking, because I want too</a></h2>
            <p>Tonight I came across two blog posts in Reeder as I was lying in bed catching up on my feeds and watching the Formula One. The <a href="https://audacious.blog/2021/write/">first</a> was all about writing. The author coined a phrase that is very reminiscent of Michael Pollan’s approach to food.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Write sentences, not too many, mostly active.</p>
</blockquote>
