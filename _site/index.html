            <h2 class="h1"><a href="/2021/World-Elephant-Day">World Elephant Day Is Today</a></h2>
            <p>This morning I found out that it’s world elephant day. It’s one of those facts which has stuck in my mind ever since for the simple fact that elephants are my favourite animals.</p>

            <p>As the title says, welcome to the eighth official version of my blog. This one has been a while in the making. It started as a new theme on Wordpress over a year ago, included a short holiday on Ghost before ending up being powered by Jekyll. That makes this the first version of my blog not to be powered by Wordpress and in all honesty it’s a refreshing change.</p>

            <p>Yesterday as I was sat on my sofa watching the Sunday morning church service on YouTube I had my MacBook Pro open on my lap to make notes in Obsidian. After the service had finished I spent a few minutes to tidy up some formatting and make sure the correct bible verses were being referenced, I realised how much I am enjoying using the app. It got me thinking about why.</p>

            <p>Today is Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, in Israel. Racism has been in the news a lot of the last year or so, and yet we hear very little of the fact that anti-semitism is on the rise.</p>

            <p>I’ve been continuing to seek out a notes app that works for me as well as I would like it too. A couple of weeks ago I posted about <a href="https://philbowell.com/2021/searching-for-the-perfect-notes-app/">what I’m looking for</a> and since then I’ve been giving a couple of the contenders a try.</p>

            <p>Tonight I came across two blog posts in Reeder as I was lying in bed catching up on my feeds and watching the Formula One. The <a href="https://audacious.blog/2021/write/">first</a> was all about writing. The author coined a phrase that is very reminiscent of Michael Pollan’s approach to food.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Write sentences, not too many, mostly active.</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>For the last 6 months or so I have been using Roam Research as my notes app. The daily note turned into my home from home allowing me to capture things throughout the day. Thoughts, feelings, meeting notes, tasks, articles I read, videos I watched, everything got noted down in the daily note. Using the service has encouraged me to read more wisely, making notes from articles that are useful and capturing highlights and thoughts as I read books.</p>

            <p>There’s nothing quite like writing down the routine you’ve found yourself falling into to make you realise there’s somethings you’d like to change. When I <a href="https://philbowell.com/2021/routines/" title="Routines">posted</a> about my routine the other week it made me more conscious of what I’ve been doing in the morning so I started to pay more attention to what I was doing last week.</p>

            <p>On my lunch break today as I sat reading some RSS feeds, I came across a [Daily Blogging Challenge] that started on the first of March. As I clicked through to the organising site to find out more I discovered that each day they are sharing a prompt word that everyone taking part should use to kickstart their post for the day. I’m not going to commit to taking part everyday, but I liked the prompt from 1st March, [routine].</p>

            <p>I’ve recently made some changes to the hosting for my blog and other websites as part of the consolidation of my many websites in to one. I had been aiming to have one website to rule them all integrating my portfolio and my blog into one site.</p>
