    <h1>hello world!</h1>
    <p>I'm a Christian, a designer, and a gadget fan who lives in Cheltenham, UK.</p>

    <p>This is my blog, a creative outlet to mess around and play with as well as a place that logs my thoughts and inspirations.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2021/04/12/thinking.html">A tool for thinking</a></h2>
        <p>Yesterday as I was sat on my sofa watching the Sunday morning church service on YouTube I had my MacBook Pro open on my lap to make notes in Obsidian. After the service had finished I spent a few minutes to tidy up some formatting and make sure the correct bible verses were being referenced, I realised how much I am enjoying using the app. It got me thinking about why.</p>

        <p>Today is Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, in Israel. Racism has been in the news a lot of the last year or so, and yet we hear very little of the fact that anti-semitism is on the rise.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2021/04/04/notes-app-quest.html">The notes app quest continues</a></h2>
        <p>I’ve been continuing to seek out a notes app that works for me as well as I would like it too. A couple of weeks ago I posted about <a href="https://philbowell.com/2021/searching-for-the-perfect-notes-app/">what I’m looking for</a> and since then I’ve been giving a couple of the contenders a try.</p>

        <p>Tonight I came across two blog posts in Reeder as I was lying in bed catching up on my feeds and watching the Formula One.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2021/03/18/searching-for-notes-app.html">Searching for the perfect notes app</a></h2>
        <p>For the last 6 months or so I have been using Roam Research as my notes app. The daily note turned into my home from home allowing me to capture things throughout the day. Thoughts, feelings, meeting notes, tasks, articles I read, videos I watched, everything got noted down in the daily note. Using the service has encouraged me to read more wisely, making notes from articles that are useful and capturing highlights and thoughts as I read books.</p>

        <p>There’s nothing quite like writing down the routine you’ve found yourself falling into to make you realise there’s somethings you’d like to change. When I <a href="https://philbowell.com/2021/routines/" title="Routines">posted</a> about my routine the other week it made me more conscious of what I’ve been doing in the morning so I started to pay more attention to what I was doing last week.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2021/03/03/routines.html">Routines</a></h2>
        <p>On my lunch break today as I sat reading some RSS feeds, I came across a [Daily Blogging Challenge] that started on the first of March. As I clicked through to the organising site to find out more I discovered that each day they are sharing a prompt word that everyone taking part should use to kickstart their post for the day. I’m not going to commit to taking part everyday, but I liked the prompt from 1st March, [routine].</p>

        <p>I’ve recently made some changes to the hosting for my blog and other websites as part of the consolidation of my many websites in to one. I had been aiming to have one website to rule them all integrating my portfolio and my blog into one site.</p>

        <p>We have been in Lockdown 3 for a few weeks now as Covid-19 continues to spread through the population. The government issued stay at home notices again, but this time people don’t seem to be following things quite as closely.</p>

        <p>I’ve always enjoyed reading and for as long as I can remember I’ve read fiction. Several years ago I got surprised with a Kindle for Christmas from my parents. It caused me to increase dramatically the number of books I was reading.</p>

        <p>Over the years I’ve amassed a number of domains for various websites I’ve wanted to create. A few of those are related to my former freelance business, and two relates to blogs. This week I got a notification that 3 of them are up for renewal in January, it’s left me questioning if should renew them all or if it’s time to let some go.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2020/11/29/grey-day.html">Grey day</a></h2>
        <p>Today has been a grey and foggy day, it’s felt like a real reflection of the mood of the last month. As I’ve driven around Cheltenham today doing some bits and bobs, I’ve seen more and more people starting to put up Christmas trees and lights. It’s been nice to see them emerging out of the gloom.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2020/11/26/thanksgiving.html">Thanksgiving</a></h2>
        <p>Today is Thanksgiving in America, and despite being a Brit I thought it would be good to try and post something I’m thankful for this year. I started to write this post at lunchtime, and struggled, I couldn’t zero in on something. This evening after my counselling session I realised what it is I’m thankful for this year. I’m thankful for all the people who have helped my family navigate through the year. The members of their church, some old friends from previous churches, some new friends, some new colleagues who have become friends. Some people who were friends and I’ve discovered are now very good friends. For all of them I am thankful, we couldn’t have done it without you.</p>

        <p>Since the end of August I’ve been using Roam Research as my notes application. Having tried and played around with Notion but finding it to be too much work to manage anything, I decided to give Roam and it’s freeform notes a try.</p>

        <p>I’ve had this blog in one form or another since I was 21, earlier posts have been lost in the many transitions it has made but it’s always been there. A hobby that taught me how to design and build websites that has since become my career.</p>
